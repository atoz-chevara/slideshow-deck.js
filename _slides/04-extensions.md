## Extensions

Core gives you basic slide functionality with left and right arrow navigation,
but you may want more. Here are the ones included in this deck:

- **deck.goto**: Adds a shortcut key to jump to any slide number.  Hit g, type in the slide number, and hit enter.
- **deck.hash**: Enables internal linking within slides, deep linking to individual slides, and updates the address bar and a permalink anchor with each slide change.
- **deck.menu**: Adds a menu view, letting you see all slides in a grid. Hit m to toggle to menu view, continue navigating your deck, and hit m to return to normal view. Touch devices can double-tap the deck to switch between views.
- **deck.navigation**: Adds clickable left and right buttons for the less keyboard inclined.
- **deck.status**: Adds a page number indicator. (current/total)

Each extension folder in the download package contains the necessary JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files. For a complete list of extension modules included in deck.js, check out the  [documentation](http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js/docs).
